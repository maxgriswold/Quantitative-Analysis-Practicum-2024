## Plan for today

::: fragment
- Discuss format and norms of peer review.
:::

::: fragment
- Briefly cover seminar discussion and academic writing advice.
:::

::: fragment
- Go over format for final workshops
:::

## Peer review - Purpose

- Peer review is narrowly defined: The purpose is to validate the work and improve (scientific) quality.

::: fragment
- Typically single-blinded, though double-blind is becoming more common.
:::

::: fragment
- In practice, working the refs and networking can be important to get past peer-review.
:::

## Peer review - norms

## Peer review - The process

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
- Peer review follows a standard practice across journals.
:::

::: fragment
::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
- Authors submit journal article and a cover letter to the submission portal.
:::
:::

::: fragment
::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
- Editors reach out to possible experts and get confirmation they'll review.
:::
:::

::: fragment
::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
- Reviewers read article, write 1-2 page review, score submission, and send comments to editor.
:::
:::

::: fragment
::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
- The editor makes a decision, based off reviews and their own judgment. If there are requested revisions, the process repeats.
:::

## Peer review - Tips

- Read the paper twice. First arrive at an initial impression and a summary. Second, revise summary and drill down on critiques.

::: fragment
- Look closely at equation, tables, and figures. Does this evidence align with the written text?
:::

::: fragment
- Be a detective and follow the references. Do they actually support an argument? Where are cites needed?
:::

::: fragment
- If possible, sit on the paper for a day and come back to it. What stayed with you?
:::

## Peer review - Format

![](./figs/lancet_portal_2.png)

## Peer review - Format

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
- Most reviews are short (1-2 pages) and to-the-point.
:::

::: fragment
::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
- Reviews usually start with a summary of the article's thesis, main points, positive traits, and professional boilerplate. Do not state to the author if you are accepting or rejecting the article.
:::
:::

::: fragment
::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
- Major criticism focuses on method validity and arguments. Are the findings suppported by the evidence?
:::
:::

::: fragment
::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
- Minor criticism focuses on clarity and presentation. Is the author's point clear?
:::
:::

::: fragment
::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
- Reviewers are not responsible for style!

## Seminar discussions 

- We all share responsibility in making seminar discussions lively and beneficial (not just the author).

::: fragment
- For the speaker: Ask the audience directly what you want from the seminar!
:::

::: fragment
- For discussants: Be clear, positive, and respectful with comments. How can you provide feedback and questions using a collaborative framing?
:::

## Seminar discussions -  examples

- Consider framing questions and comments personally, rather than generally.

::: fragment
Rather than, "This is not the right way to do method X", perhaps, "I would consider trying to apply method X like this".
:::

::: fragment
- Clarity matters - if you can't follow an argument, this comment can be helpful for speakers.
:::

::: fragment
"Figure X wasn't entirely clear to me. Could you help me understand what this is showing?"
:::

## Seminar discussions -  examples

- Positive feedback can also be helpful for speakers. What worked well?

::: fragment
"Figure X made this argument clear and convincing."
:::

::: fragment
- To make your positive feedback more valuable, perhaps also recommend extensions?
:::

::: fragment
"Have you also tried investigating if. . ?"
:::

::: fragment
- If possible, please be concise in your remarks! 
:::

## Writing reports - advice

- Writing content can not be separated from style. Arguments require clarity.

::: fragment
- Be clear. Do not distract your reader with interjections or waste their time.
:::

::: fragment
- Write accessibly. Use plain language and be boring.
:::

::: fragment
- Good writing requires good observation. Emulate good reports.
:::

## Writing reports - advice

- Start early. You need to write and rewrite multiple times. 

::: fragment
"Easy writing makes hard reading" - McCloskey
:::

::: fragment
- Have a specific reader in mind at all times.
:::

::: fragment
- Every paragraph should have a clear point and contribute to a broader argument.
:::

::: fragment
- Use active language! (e.g., not "active language should be used")
:::


## Writing reports - advice

::: fragment
- Footnotes are pedantic and should only provide additional sourcing. 
:::

::: fragment
- Sourcing should be specific, if permitted!
:::

::: fragment
- Play around with your sentences. Tinker. 
:::

::: fragment
- Read outloud. How do sentences cohere together?
:::

## Next week

We'll briefly discuss writing workshops. \
\

::: fragment
We will have additional time to cover an additional topic. What would be helpful material to cover?
:::

::: fragment
Please sign up for a 30 minute workshop session!
