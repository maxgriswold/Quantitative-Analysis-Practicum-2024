## Plan for today

::: fragment
- Discuss how to build models through iteration.
:::

::: fragment
- Go over model evaluation strategies.
:::

::: fragment
- Demonstrate how simulation methods can improve analysis presentation.
:::

## Today's resources

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
Today's lecture draws heavily from Gelman and Hill. This textbook contains a wealth of useful information on building models. For today, we are focusing on building and evaluating predictive models, rather than causal models.

## Model building principles

::: fragment
- Have a theoretical model in mind before starting your analysis
:::

::: fragment
- Start with simple models and methods, then introduce complexity as you check for problems.
:::


::: fragment
- Fit lots of models and rely on figures to diagnose problems rather than only goodness-of-fit statistics.
:::

## Which variables to include?

::: fragment
* Start with all input variables you expect will be important in predicting the outcome.
:::
::: fragment
::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
  (keeping in mind model assumptions and pitfalls, such as conditioning on post-treatment variables)
:::
:::

::: fragment
* If an estimate has a large effect, consider including interaction terms.
:::

::: fragment
::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
  (keeping in mind sample size limitations. You need about 16x sample to estimate an interaction compared to a main effect [Gelman, 2018](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2018/03/15/))
:::
:::

##  Which variables to exclude?

::: fragment
* If a covariate is not significant and has an expected sign, it doesn't hurt to keep them in.
:::

::: fragment
* If a covariate is not significant and has an unexpected sign, you might want to remove it (implicitly set it's coefficient to zero).
:::

::: fragment
* If a covariate is significant and has an unexpected sign, put on you detective hat. Are there latent variables?

## Evaluating model performance

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
For predictive models, the critical question is whether our model correctly predicts the outcome. We can check our model's performance by looking at three types plots: Empirical density plots, predicted v. observed scatterplots., and error v. predicted value scatterplots.
